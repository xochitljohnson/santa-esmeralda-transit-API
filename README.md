# Santa Esmeralda Transit System API
 
 > A REST API for a fictious transit system. 

 ## Objective

 The objective of this project is to demonstrate profficiency in a number of backend technologies and best practices. 

 For v1, the REST API will provide information about times and stops for the transit system. Future versions will include more information or other details.  

 The project will consist of a public API provided by a city/central organization for consumption through app clients such as Transit or Google Maps. There will also be a private API for transit admins. And a portal for viewing information by public users. In the future I plan to add more "services" for users by introducing ride history, payments and more. 

## Background

This project is set to function as a portfolio item. It's inspired by my experiences living in Southern California, my interest in transit systems and my desire to demonstrate knowledge in backend development.
